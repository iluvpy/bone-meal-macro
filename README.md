# bone-meal-macro
a simple macro for minecraft for minecraft to farm using bonemeal

## Dependencies
Python >= 3.7, never tried maybe a lower version works fine too
virtualenv (venv) library, should generally already be installed

# OS
should work on both windows/max/linux but i only have a linux machine so i dont know if it works.
if it doesnt it's probably a one line fix

## Usage
just run `run_macro.py`.    
Note: It will create a python env installing everything from requirements.txt if you never ran the macro before
After that you are setup, just go to your minecraft world and look at a farmland block (without a crop placed in it),   
you also need to have bone meal in your main hand and the crop you want to autofarm in your off hand (this is important)   
then just press the key `run_macro.py` requested. Press it again to stop the macro.
Happy farming! 
Note: choose a keybind you dont accidentally press and be careful in general
